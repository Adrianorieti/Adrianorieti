Hi there! I'm Adriano Pace, CS student and programmer in Bologna.

My main interests are: sysadministration, cybersecurity, linux.
My favourite languages are <b>bash</b> and "what else do you need  after bash ? ".
I also deal with C and javascript programming.
Always looking out to get more experience.
I started my real journey in the tech world the first day of University, and i'm doing my best to grow up as a skilled IT guy.

I'm also in love with martial arts and good music.
You can contact me at paceadrianolavoro@gmail.com, I'll be glad to answer you.
Peace
